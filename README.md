# 🌎 COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization in Python

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing COVID-19 data for India using Python. By leveraging libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**, I created insightful visualizations to explore trends in **deaths**, **discharge ratios**, and **total cases** across various states and union territories (UTs) in India. 

## 📊 Features
- Cleaned and prepared real-world COVID-19 data for analysis.
- Aggregated data at the state/UT level to identify regional trends.
- Visualized key metrics such as total cases, deaths, and discharge ratios using clear and informative plots.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: The programming language used for the entire project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: [Provide dataset source link, if available] 
- **Description**: The dataset contains information about COVID-19 cases, deaths, recovery rates, and other related metrics for each state/UT in India.

## 🔄 Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**:
    - Loaded the dataset using `Pandas`.
    - Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
2. **Data Aggregation**:
    - Grouped data by states/UTs to calculate aggregated metrics like total deaths, total cases, and discharge ratios.
3. **Visualization**:
    - Created visually appealing line plots to show trends in deaths, discharge ratios, and total cases for each state.

## 🎨 Sample Visualizations
### Trends in COVID-19 Metrics:
- Deaths (red line), Discharge Ratios (blue line), and Total Cases (green line) for each state.
- X-axis: States/UTs
- Y-axis: Metric values

## 🏆 Key Insights
- Identified trends in recovery and discharge ratios across different states.
- Highlighted regions with the highest and lowest death counts, providing a better understanding of pandemic management across India.

## 💡 Challenges & Learnings
- **Challenges**:
    - Managing missing and inconsistent data.
    - Adjusting visualizations to accommodate all states/UTs for better readability.
- **Learnings**:
    - Enhanced data analysis and visualization skills.
    - Gained experience in handling real-world datasets effectively.

## 🗃️ How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository_link]
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd covid19_data_analysis
